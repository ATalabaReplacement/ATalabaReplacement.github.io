                <p class='black helvetica'>The Box House is easily accessible (by car) from either John F. Kennedy International Airport or LaGuardia Airport. Please note that the hotel is a 10-minute walk to the Vernon-Jackson MTA stop on the 7 train (which is only one station away from Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan). The Greenpoint Avenue G train is located only 7 blocks from the hotel.  </p>
                <p class='black helvetica'>The Box House Hotel does not offer parking, however they are located in a residential neighborhood, in which there is free street parking. We do advise all guests to be cautious of alternate street parking. There are a couple parking garages within a ten minute walk of the hotel.

            <p class='monospaced'>ERIKA_+_ANDREI</p>
            <p class='helvetica'>Erika and Andrei met in college. After years of late night Collegetown Bagels dinners, shopping at Target, and making their friends feel like third wheels, Andrei finally asked Erika out the day after his 20th birthday, a few weeks after they had signed an 8 person housing lease.</p>
            <p class='helvetica'>Thankfully, despite their friends' initial fears, they didn't break up during their last few years of college. Their relationship kept going through long distance internships, straight-out-of-college moving struggles, and over a year of quarantining in a one-bedroom apartment. Until one day, Andrei managed to snag a key to Gramercy Park, and asked Erika to marry him on a cold Winter's day.</p>
